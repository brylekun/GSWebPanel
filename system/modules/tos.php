echo '<h3>Term of service </h3><hr>';
echo'Good day, Student Leaders! We would like to inform you that we have revised our Term of Service (TOS), the rules and regulations that govern our game. We have removed and added rules in order for our TOS to adapt with our game\'s current situation. With this revised TOS and your cooperation, we are hoping to make Ran World a much more safer and organized environment for everyone. This revised TOS will be effective on 16th of April 2015. To see the changes we have made, just click on the links below.';
